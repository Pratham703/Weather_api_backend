# Event Weather Guard

**“Will It Rain During My Event?”**

Event Weather Guard is a backend service that analyzes **hourly weather forecasts** for outdoor events and determines whether the event is **Safe**, **Risky**, or **Unsafe** using **deterministic and explainable rules**.
If the event is risky or unsafe, the service recommends a **better time window within the next 24 hours**.

---

* Fetches **hourly weather forecast** from Open-Meteo
* Applies **rule-based weather classification**
* Returns:

  * Event classification (Safe / Risky / Unsafe)
  * Severity score (0–100)
  * Clear explanation of triggered rules
  * Hour-by-hour forecast for the event window
  * Optional alternate time window recommendation
* No authentication
* No persistence (fully stateless)

---

## Tech Stack

* **Python 3.10+**
* **FastAPI**

### Example Response

```json
{
  "classification": "Risky",
  "severity_score": 37,
  "summary": "Rain probability is 80% at 07:00",
  "reason": [
    "Rain probability is 80% at 07:00"
  ],
  "event_window_forecast": [
    {
      "time": "07:00",
      "rain_prob": 80,
      "wind_kmh": 4.7,

    }
  ],
  "recommended_alternate_window": {
    "start_time": "21:00",
    "end_time": "00:00",
    "reason": "Lower rain probability and calmer winds expected"
  }
}
```

## Project Workflow

1. Client sends event details (location + time window)
2. Hourly forecast data is fetched from Open-Meteo
3. Forecast hours are filtered to match the event window
4. Weather rules are evaluated hour-by-hour
5. Severity score is calculated
6. Event is classified as Safe / Risky / Unsafe
7. If Risky or Unsafe, a better window is searched within the next 24 hours
8. A structured, explainable response is returned

---

## Time-Window Forecast Handling

* Only forecast hours overlapping with the event window are considered
* Filtering logic:

```python
event.start_time <= forecast_hour < event.end_time
```

* Ensures accurate handling of short or partial-hour events

---

## Weather Classification Rules

### Unsafe

Triggered if **any hour** satisfies:

* Thunderstorm weather codes `{95, 96, 99}`
* Heavy rain (`precipitation_mm ≥ 5`)
* Extreme wind (`wind_speed > 40 km/h`)

### Risky

Triggered if **no Unsafe rules**, but any hour has:

* Rain probability ≥ 60%
* Moderate wind (`20–40 km/h`)
* Light to moderate precipitation

### Safe

* None of the above conditions apply across the event window
* Worst-case condition dominates the final classification

---

## Severity Score Logic (0–100)

Severity score provides a numeric representation of risk.

Weighted contributors:

* Rain probability
* Precipitation (mm)
* Wind speed (km/h)
* Thunderstorm presence (strong penalty)

Final score = **maximum severity across all event hours**

| Range  | Meaning |
| ------ | ------- |
| 0–20   | Safe    |
| 21–60  | Risky   |
| 61–100 | Unsafe  |

---

## Alternate Time Recommendation Logic

Applied **only if event is Risky or Unsafe**.

Logic:

1. Scan hourly forecast for the **next 24 hours**
2. Apply the same safety rules to each hour
3. Search for a **continuous block of safer hours**
4. Select the best available window based on:

   * Lower rain probability
   * Minimal precipitation
   * Calmer winds

If no suitable window exists:

```json
"recommended_alternate_window": null
```

## Example curl Request (Optional)

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/event-forecast \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
  "name": "Football Match",
  "location": { "latitude": 10.79, "longitude": 79.86 },
  "start_time": "2026-01-13T07:00:00",
  "end_time": "2026-01-13T09:00:00"
}'
```

---

## Console Logging (Observability)

The service includes **lightweight console logging** for observability and debugging.

### What is logged

* Incoming event forecast requests
* Classification results (Safe / Risky / Unsafe)
* Severity score outcomes
* Alternate time window recommendations
* Validation and processing errors

### Why logging is used

* Trace request flow and decision-making
* Debug rule evaluation and recommendations
* Improve transparency during local testing

### No persistence guarantee

* Logs are written **only to the console (stdout)**
* No files, databases, or external logging systems
* Event data is not stored
* Service remains **fully stateless**

---

## Edge-Case Handling

* Invalid time window (`start_time >= end_time`)
* No forecast data for event window
* Incorrect datetime formats
* External API failures

All return appropriate HTTP error responses.

---

## Key Assumptions & Trade-offs

* Uses Open-Meteo for free, reliable hourly data
* No database or persistence
* Forecast accuracy depends on external provider
* Recommendation limited to next 24 hours
* Conservative weather-code mapping for safety
